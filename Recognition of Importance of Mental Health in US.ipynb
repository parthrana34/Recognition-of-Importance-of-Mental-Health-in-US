Given the tech industry's rapid growth over the past few decades, I believe it would be valuable to examine the industry's employee access to mental health resources and their understanding of these resources.\n \nI aim to answer the question: In 2014, did employers in the US tech industry recognize the importance of mental health?\n \n<b>Benefits of Survey Data</b>\n \nAs this dataset includes thoughts from the workers' perspectives, it provides a closer look into gauging the need for mental health resources and whether resources currently offered are effective. To fully answer the question I propose, feedback from the employers would also be needed to compare the resources that are perceived to be available and which resources are actually available. With the limited data, however, I am still able to at least understand which resources employees perceive to be available. Additionally, the data provide insight as to whether an employee perceives that an employer recognizes the importance of mental health.\n \n<b>Presentation Contents</b>\n \n* Accordingly, I break down my analysis into three areas, which align closely with the variables provided in the dataset: \n    (1) Whether there is a need for mental health resources in the workplace, \n    (2) whether the employer is perceived to recognize the importance of mental health, and \n    (3) whether the employer offers resources to employees for mental health issues. \n \n<a href \"https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey\">The dataset can be found here.</a>\n \nComments are very welcome!\n \n## Loading Packages\nLook at code for details.\n```{r Loading_Packages, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}\n# Loading packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n \n## Loading the Data and First Peek\nLook at code for details.\n \nHere are the `str` and `summary`.\n```{r First_Peek}\n# Loading data\nData <- read.csv(\"../input/survey.csv\")\n \n# Taking first peek\nstr(Data)\nsummary(Data)\n```\n \n## Cleaning Age and Timestamp\n \nFor the most part, it appears that the variables are clean. That being said, the gender and age variables need to be cleaned and the timestamp should be separated to to access the dates within.\n\nIn the code, I clean the age variable and separate the timestamp. The spread of respondents genders' is below.\n \n```{r Cleaning_Age_Timestamp}\n# Cleaning age variable\nData$Age <-\n  ifelse(Data$Age < 12, \"\", # I think we can all safely say that anyone younger than 12 does not \"work\" in the tech industry\n  ifelse(Data$Age > 150, \"\", Data$Age)) %>% # No one is this old, so this will probably solve the higher numbers problem\n  as.numeric()\n \n# Separating timestamp\nData$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(strptime(Data$Timestamp, format = \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n \n# Looking into genders to understand how to clean\ntable(Data$Gender)\n```\n \n## Cleaning Gender\n \n* Notes before I \"clean\" the gender variable:\n    + I love the representation of non-binary and inter-dichotomy genders in this dataset!\n    + Although there are quite a few participants who specify whether they are trans, not everyone was asked to make such a distinction. Thus, I include them in the gender they identify as (i.e. \"Trans-female\" being included in \"Female\").\n    + Although it is important to not marginalize someone because of their gender, there are so few people identifying as non-male/non-female that I place them all in one category for ease of analysis.\n \n```{r Cleaning_Gender}\n# Setting up the entries into gender \"categories\" for ease of analysis\nGenMale <- c(\"cis male\", \"Cis Male\", \"Cis Man\", \"m\", \"M\", \"Mail\", \"maile\", \"Make\", \"Mal\", \"male\", \"Male\", \"Male \", \"Male (CIS)\", \"Malr\", \"Man\", \"msle\")\nGenFemale <- c(\"cis-female/femme\", \"Cis Female\", \"f\", \"F\", \"femail\", \"Femake\", \"female\", \"Female\", \"Female \", \"Female (cis)\", \"Female (trans)\", \"Trans-female\", \"Trans woman\", \"woman\", \"Woman\")\n \n# Assigning the entries according to \"categories\"\nData$GenderClean <-\n  ifelse((Data$Gender %in% GenMale), \"Male\", # Assigning \"Male\" to those who entered a string contained in GenMale\n  ifelse((Data$Gender %in% GenFemale), \"Female\", \"Non-M/F\")) %>% # Assigning \"Female\" to those who entered a string contained in GenFemale\n  as.factor()\n \n# Observing cleaned table\ntable(Data$GenderClean)\n```\n \nNow that the cleaning is completed, let's get the data that is needed for analysis to answer the primary question.\n \n## Filtering Data\nHere's the final `summary`!\n```{r Filter_Data}\n# Creating new dataset with filtered rows\nTechData <- Data %>%\n  filter(tech_company == \"Yes\" & # Making sure dataset includes only those in a tech company\n         format(Timestamp, \"%Y\") == 2014 & # Making sure dataset includes only responses from 2014\n         Country == \"United States\") # Making sure dataset includes only responses from US\n \nsummary(TechData)\n```\n \n# Analysis\n \n* As noted in the introduction, I break down my analysis into three areas: \n    (1) Whether there is a need for mental health resources in the workplace, \n    (2) whether the employer is perceived to recognize the importance of mental health, and \n    (3) whether the employer offers resources to employees for mental health issues.\n \n## Need for Mental Health Resources {.tabset}\n<b>Mental Health Condition Prevalence</b>\n \nA large portion of the United States population faces issues with mental health. <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-mental-illness-ami-among-us-adults.shtml\">According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), about 17.9% of the US population experienced a mental illness from 2014-2015.</a> Naturally, any survey taken will have some bias, but the NIMH notes that about 1/3 of the sample did not complete the survey and that those with mental illness may disproportionately fall into this category. \n \nIt is important to note that the NIMH survey only counted mental illnesses that are diagnosable or disorders are mentally-, behaviorally-, or emotionally-based. Thus, the self-reporting from the respondents may not reflect the actual prevalence of mental health issues. The consequences of this are discussed in the conclusion section.\n \n<b>Indicators of Mental Health Prevalence in Dataset</b>\n \n* There are three possible indicators of the prevalence of mental health issues:\n    (1) Family History:  Do you have a family history of mental illness?\n    (2) Treatment: Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?\n    (3) Work Interference: If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?\n \n<b>Things to Keep in Mind</b>\n \nThough asking about treatment can and does weed out self-diagnosis of mental illness, 'treatment' and 'mental illness' are not clearly defined. Additionally, 'mental health condition' and \"mental illness\" seemed to be used interchangeably throughout the survey. Consequently, by responding \"yes\" to seeking treatment for a mental health condition, respondents may mean that they have had therapy for a breakup or that they had pills described to them for a diagnosis of depression. \n \nThis bias is incredibly important to keep in mind when looking at the results, especially considering that the answers to this question are the primary indicators of mental  for the analysis. Note that, in this analysis, I use 'mental illness' and 'mental health condition' interchangeably unless specified by the survey.\n \n<b>Graphs</b>\n \nHere's a look at these variables. Note that I include the questions asked to the respondents before the figures so that the responses are given further context.\n \n### Family History\n<h3><center>Do you have a family history of mental illness?</center></h3>\n```{r Prevalence_Family_History}\n# Setting up colors for clarity\nYesNoMaybe <- c(\"No\" = \"#ed2828\", \"Yes\" = \"2bed28\", \"Maybe\" = \"#ede628\", \"Not sure\" = \"#ede628\", \"Don't know\" = \"#ede628\")\n \n# Pie Chart time!\nTechData %>%\n  count(family_history) %>% #

Setting up colors for clarity\n  layout(title = \"Responses\")\n```\n\nBased on the sample, a large percentage of people in the tech industry in the US have a family history of mental illness.\n \n### Treatment\n<h3><center>Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?</center></h3>\n```{r Prevalence_Treatment}\nTechData %>%\n  count(treatment) %>% # Counting the people in \"treatment\" to put in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    labels = ~treatment,\n    values = ~n,\n    type = \"pie\", # Setting type of chart to pie\n    textposition = 'inside', # Setting area for text\n    textinfo = 'label+percent', #

Setting up colors for clarity\n  layout(title = \"Responses\")\n```\n\nBased on the responses (assuming it is a representative sample), it looks like a _much_ larger percentage of people in the tech industry experience mental health issues, indicated by their seeking of treatment.\n \n### Work Interfere\n<h3><center>If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?</center></h3>\n```{r Prevalence_Work_Interfere}\n# Setting color scheme for clarity\nWICol <- c(\"Often\" = \"#2bed28\", \"Never\" = \"#ed2828\", \"Rarely\" = \"#ede628\", \"Sometimes\" = \"#eaa927\", \"No Answer\" = \"#bababa\")\n \n# Pie chart!\nTechData %>%\n  count(work_interfere) %>% #

Additionally, it does not appear there are large differences between the groups, which probably indicates that workers perceive their environments to be the same regardless of whether they sought treatment for a mental health condition.\n \n### Supervisor\n<h3><center>Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?</center></h3>\n```{r Perceptions_Supervisor, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(supervisor, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~supervisor,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = YSMBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.1, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nAgain, like with the coworker variable, a majority of employees are willing to discuss mental health issues with at least some of their supervisors. Compared with the coworker variable, however, employees seem to be less willing to discuss mental health issues with supervisors.\n \nThat being said, there are large differences between those who have/have not sought treatment. Specifically, people who have sought treatment are only willing to speak to some or none of their supervisors more often than those who have not sought treatment.\n \n### Observed Consequence\n<h3><center>Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace?</center></h3>\n```{r Perceptions_Observed_Consequence, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Specifying the order of bars for the chart\nNYBarOrder <- c(\"No\", \"Yes\")\n \n# Here's the chart!\nTechData %>%\n  count(obs_consequence, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~obs_consequence,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.6, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nOverall, a vast majority of people have not seen negative consequences in their workplace for others with mental health issues. This is great! \n \nThat being said, people who have sought treatment for mental health issues have observed more negative consequences.\n \n## Actual Availability of Resources {.tabset}\n \nHere is a look into whether resources are available to employees for mental health! Again, I break down into those who have sought treatment and those who have not.\n \n### Benefits\n<h3><center>Does your employer provide mental health benefits?</center></h3>\n```{r Resources_Benefits, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Specifying the order of bars for the chart\nNYDBarOrder <- c(\"No\", \"Yes\", \"Don't know\")\n \n# Here's the chart!\nTechData %>%\n  count(benefits, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~benefits,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.1, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nFor the most part, it looks like a majority of respondents indicated that mental health benefits are provided by an employer. Unsurprisingly, those who have sought treatment know better than those who have not whether their employer does or does not provide these benefits.\n \n### Care Options\n<h3><center>Do you know the options for mental health care your employer provides?</center></h3>\n```{r Resources_Care_Options, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Specifying the order of bars for the chart\nNYNBarOrder <- c(\"No\", \"Yes\", \"Not sure\")\n \n# Here's the chart!\nTechData %>%\n  count(care_options, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~care_options,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYNBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.1, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nAgain, similar to the benefits variable, it is unsurprising that many more employees who have sought treatment know of the mental health care options available to them from their employer. \n \nThat being said, a majority of people who have not sought treatment _do not know_ what care options are available to them from their employer. \n \n### Wellness Program\n<h3><center>Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?</center></h3>\n```{r Resources_Wellness_Program, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(wellness_program, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~wellness_program,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYDBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.7, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nThe great majority of people report their employer not discussing mental health as a part of an employee wellness program. Unsurprisingly, a greater proportion of employees who have sought treatment answered either \"yes\" or \"no\", indicating that they are more aware of their employer communications regarding the subject. \n \n### Seek Help\n<h3><center>Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?</center></h3>\n```{r Resources_Seek_Help, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(seek_help, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~seek_help,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYDBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.7, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n</center>\nA large percentage of employers do not provide resources for more information and seeking help, according to the responses. Alarmingly, a large percentage of people do not know whether this is the case.\n \nAs with the wellness program, a greater proportion of people who have sought treatment for mental health issues know whether an employer provides resources for seeking help or for more information when compared to those who have not sought treatment.\n \n### Anonymity\n<h3><center>Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources?</center></h3><center>\n```{r Resources_Anonymity, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(anonymity, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~anonymity,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\", # Setting up x-axis title\n                      categoryorder = 'array',\n                      categoryarray = NYDBarOrder), # Setting up order of bars\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\"), # Setting up y-axis title\n         legend = list(x = 0.05, y=0.95)) # Moving legend\n```\n\nAlarmingly, a huge proportion of respondents do not know whether their anonymity would be protected it utilizing resources that their employer offers. \n \nThat being said, a larger proportion of those who have sought treatment do know whether this is the case, perhaps indicating that they have utilized the resources their employer offers.\n \n# Conclusions and Recommendations\n \n* Before jumping to conclusions, it is important to understand some of the limitations of this data. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n    + Given that anyone can visit <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">Open Source Mental Illness</a>'s website and take the survey, there is probably a lot of bias in the representation of the members of the industry.\n    + The purpose of the organization is to raise awareness of mental health in the tech and open source workplace. Though I applaud this goal (it truly is an amazing one!), the questions may be formatted as to bring about a specific conclusion aligning with their end-goal.\n    + More will be discussed in the coming sections!\n \n## Need for Resources\n \n### Measuring Mental Health Prevalence {.tabset}\n<b>Sought Treatment Variable</b>\n\nAlthough the measure of mental illness is difficult in general, the closest measure in this dataset is the \"sought treatment\" variable, which indicates whether a respondent has sought treatment for a mental health condition. \n\n<b>Family History and Work Interference Variables</b>\n\nIn the section above, I also included the \"family history\" and \"work interfere\" variables, through which respondents indicate whether they have a family history of mental illness and how much their mental health condition interferes with their work, respectively. \n\nAs we can see by the tables below, those with a family history of mental illness have higher rates of having sought treatment, and those who experience work interference due to a mental health condition are more likely to have sought treatment for a mental health condition.\n\nAccordingly, these variables all roughly articulate the same thing - the prevalence of mental health issues in our sample.\n\n#### Similarities: Treatment and Family History\n<h3><center>Do you have a family history of mental illness?</center></h3>\n```{r Similarities_Treatment_Family_History, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(family_history, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~family_history,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\"), # Setting up x-axis title\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\")) # Setting up y-axis title\n```\n\n\n#### Similarities: Treatment and Work Interference\n<h3><center>If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?</center></h3>\n```{r Similarities_Treatment_Work_Interfere, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nTechData %>%\n  count(work_interfere, treatment) %>% # Counting people by category to add in chart\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~work_interfere,\n    y = ~n,\n    type = \"bar\", # Setting type of plot to bar\n    hoverinfo = 'text', # Setting hover info (look at \"text\" on next line)\n    text = ~paste(n, \"Respondents\"), # Setting hover info\n    color = ~treatment) %>% # setting colors of bars\n  layout(title = \"\", # Setting title\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Responses\"), # Setting up x-axis title\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Number of Respondents\")) # Setting up y-axis title\n```\n\n\n### Are Resources Needed?\n<center><h4><i>Short answer: It's complicated!</i></h4></center>\n \n<b>Possible Conclusions</b>\n\n* If these variables indeed indicate the prevalence of mental illness in the tech industry, then the rates are incredibly different from the general population. The results from this sample suggest that either:\n    (1) the rates of mental illness in the tech industry are much higher than outside the tech industry, \n    (2) the rates of mental illness in the tech industry are similar to outside the industry and the sample was incredibly biased in this respect, or \n    (3) a mixture of the two.\n    \n<b>Possible Consequences</b>\n\n* If (1) is true, then the need for mental health resources and employer recognition is very high, at least compared with other industries.\n* If (2) is true, we cannot draw any conclusions on prevalence and need for resources, and thus would need a more representative sample before making conclusions about people outside our sample.\n* If (3) is true, more data would need to be collected, but it would appear that the prevalence rate of mental illness is still higher in the tech industry, indicating a need for resources.\n \n<b>Final Notes on Necessity of Resources</b>\n\n* Ultimately, it would be improper to draw any of these conclusions due to lack of data and context. \n* That being said, due to the number of people who responded, there are some valuable insights provided regarding the perception of recognition by employers and the actual availability of resources, especially for those with mental health conditions.\n \n## Do Employers Recognize the Importance of Mental Health?\n<center><h4><i>Short answer: Inconclusive</i></h4></center>\n\n<b>Environment May be Open Among Coworkers...</b>\n\n* But many fewer employees feel comfortable speaking to their supervisors about mental health. This may indicate that the work environment is open, to an extent, and that social structures are in place to allow coworkers to feel welcomed.\n\n<b>Lack of Systems</b>\n\n* However, it does not appear that there are systems in place for employees to discuss or take medical leave for mental health issues. \n* If these systems were in place, many more employees would know how easy it is to take medical leave for a mental health condition. \n* Furthermore, a majority of respondents would not feel that discussing their mental health issues might cause negative consequences and more would be willing to discuss their mental health issues with their supervisors.\n\n<b>Conclusion</b>\n* Ultimately, the variables in this dataset do not allow a firm conclusion to be made as to whether employers recognize the importance of mental health.\n* But it appears that the tech industry may be on the right track, as many employees are willing to discuss their mental health issues with at least of their coworkers and supervisors. \n* The number of observed negative consequences for those with mental health conditions seems low, though a baseline would be helpful in determining whether the tech industry's rate is actually low.\n \n## Do Employers Offer Benefits/Resources for Mental Health Issues?\n<center><h4><i>Short answer: Maybe?</i></h4></center>\n\n<b>There are Definitely _Some_ Resources</b>\n\n* As indicated by the high number of affirmative responses for questions asking if employers offer mental health benefits or resources, it appears there are at least some resources available to employees.\n\n<b>Communication About Resources Could Be Better</b>\n\n* Across all the questions regarding availability and knowledge of benefits, many respondents indicated that they did not know what benefits or resources were available to them.\n* Furthermore, over half of respondents answered that their employer has not discussed mental health as a part of an employee wellness program.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
